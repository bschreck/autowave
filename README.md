Python automation programs for .wav files


#To Use `automate_pan`

Run:

`$ ./automate_pan.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile> -p <period>`

where `<inputfile>` is a valid .wav file, `<outputfile>` is the name of the file you want to generate,
and `<period>` is the period of the circular pan in seconds.

If the script is unable to access Python, change the shebang line to `#!/usr/bin/python` or wherever your Python implementation is located.
